# scb10x-hackathon

Code base from Traveling Salesman

This code repository contains the code base for the Traveling Salesman project. The project is a submission for the SCB 10x hackathon.

The goal of this project is to propose a solution for Low resource language such as Thai.

Our proposed solution is a framework to that uses DP-GANS and Liguistincally Diversed prompting (LPD) for sythetically generate dataset for said low resource language.
This code base implements two type of technologies.
    - Diversity-Promoting GAN
    - Linguistically-Diverse Prompts (LDP)
